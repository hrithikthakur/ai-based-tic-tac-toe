# Tic-Tac-Toe-with-AI
The game can be played with user against another user, computer against user or computer against computer.
The computer mode has three levels: easy, medium and hard.
In the implementation hard level of the game, we have used the minimax algorithm. This makes the computer an undefeated champion!
We are currently working on the GUI and another implementaion that involves the Monte Carlo simulations as an AI for the game. We will update the version soon.
